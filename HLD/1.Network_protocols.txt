network protocols ->
so we have 7 layers of osi model as usual but we work with application and transport layer as of now 

application layer ->
  -->client server protocols 
    mostly HTTP,FTP,SMTP,WEBSOCKETS come under client server protocols
  -->peer to peer protocols
    WEBRTC protocols which come under peer to peer protocols 
    in this case any can be server and any can be client every one connected to each other in this such that any can work as server and any one can work as protcolos and vice versa 
    eg : bit torrent

Transport layer & network layer ->
   TCP/IP ,UDP/IP falls under transport layer  -->
    so tcp/ip form virtual connection is formed and data sent in packets with serialized number once data is recieved acknowledgement is sent to verify all data is arrived or not ,it is slower as verification and acknowledgement between two pointseg: {Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), file transfer (FTP), email (SMTP) uses tcp/ip  under hood}

    so udp/ip data is sent without coonection,no gurantee of data deleviery ,faster as no data acknowledegemt happens ,
   eg:  Live streaming,videocalling, gaming, VoIP, DNS queries
   webrtc uses udp/ip underhood
