âœ…MOnolotothic architecture ->
A monolithic architecture is a traditional software design where all components of an application are built as a single unit.
 ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
Entire app is deployed as one file/package.
Components (UI, backend, database access) are tightly coupled.

Easy to develop initially.
A single web app handling user login, order processing, and payment in one codebase.


âœ… 2. Microservice Architecture:
In microservices architecture, an application is broken down into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific feature.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
Services communicate via APIs (usually HTTP/REST or messaging).

Each service can be deployed and scaled independently.

Promotes modularity and flexibility.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
One service for user login.

One for order management.

One for payment handling.

âœ… 3. Phases in Microservice Architecture:
Decomposition â€“ Break monolith into smaller services.

Development â€“ Build and test individual services.

Communication â€“ Define how services will interact (REST, gRPC, messaging).

Deployment â€“ Deploy independently (using containers like Docker).

Monitoring & Scaling â€“ Track performance and scale services as needed.

âœ… 4. Decomposition Patterns in Microservices (in detail):
ðŸ”¹ A. Decompose by Business Capability
Break app into services based on business functions.

Example: Auth Service, Inventory Service, Payment Service.

ðŸ”¹ B. Decompose by Subdomain (Domain-Driven Design)
Use domain modeling to split the app by core, supporting, and generic domains.

ðŸ”¹ C. Decompose by Use Case/Workflow
Split services based on specific workflows or user interactions.

ðŸ”¹ D. Decompose by Resources (Entity-Based)
Create services around data entities like User, Order, Product.

âœ… 5. Advantages and Disadvantages 
ðŸ“Œ Monolithic Architecture:
Advantages	-->
Easy to develop and deploy initially
Simple testing and debugging
Disadvantages
Difficult to scale parts individually
Tightly coupled codebase
Hard to adopt new technologies
ðŸ“Œ Microservices Architecture:
advantages-->
independent scaling and deployment
Fault isolation â€“ one service down doesnâ€™t crash whole app
Technology flexibility per service
Faster development by multiple teams
Disadvantages->
Complex development and debugging
Requires DevOps, containerization, monitoring tools
Network latency and inter-service communication issues
Data consistency and transaction handling can be tricky
